# bathymetric-cam

bathymetric-cam is an AR app showing depth contour of water.

Depth contour represents how shallow or deep the water is.
If contour lines spaced narrowly between one and another, it indicates the area has the steep transition.
The kind of spot is called drop-offs by anglers when they are targeting a certain type of species.
Also, for example, largemouth bass prefers staying at deeper water when the temperature is cold in winter.
bathymetric-cam visualizes the depth contour via Augmented Reality in order to help you find a good fishing spot.
